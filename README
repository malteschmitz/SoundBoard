SoundBoard is a tiny win32 application that plays MP3 files. The MP3 files
are played if you press different keys registered as system wide hot keys
in windows. MP3 files and hot keys are specified using an ini file named
like the executable. Take a look at the example in the bin folder to see how
this works.

If you start the program you can play the files by double clicking the entry, 
selecting the entry and pressing Enter or pressing the specified hot key. By
pressing Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down you can step through the sections of the ini file.

Everything can be accessed through the list box seen on the screen and the
context menu of the list box. Its very simple and theres no more in it ;-)

SoundBoard was compiled using Turbo Delphi 2006. For registering windows system
wide hot keys the control DFHotKey is used, which seems to be no longer available
from the author. In future versions the RegisterHotkey windows api function
will be used natively.
